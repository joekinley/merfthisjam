# **Merfthisjam game - An abandoned Haxe based, HaxeFlixel powered soccer game**

**Introduction!**

This game has been made for the #fuckthisjam game jam by @vlambeer. It is a very unfinished simple soccer game, right now not more than players and a ball, where the players can kick the ball. That's it. Was a nice idea, but then abandoned.
